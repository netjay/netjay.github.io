### What is Rice?
"Rice" is a word that is commonly used to refer to making visual and or nonvisual improvements and customizations on one's desktop. The term was inherited by the *nix community from car enthusiasts (mostly U.S based) who referred to non-perfomance enhancing modifications as "Ricey" or "Riced out". Although the term doesn't translate directly (being that many ricing techniques can be performance enhancing) it has stuck, and throughout the *nix community, the word is accepted by the majority of users to refer to a visually attractive desktop upgraded beyond the default.
