### Who am I?

Well, I'm Jay.
I'm a 25 year old ITS currently employed by [Fungi Perfecti LLC.](https://www.fungi.com "Makers of HostDefense Mushrooms") working towards being able to call myself a Linux/Unix System Admin. I graduated in fall of 2018 from [SPSCC](https://www.spscc.edu "South Puget Sound Community College") with an AA-S in Network Administration and an AA-S in I.T Desktop Support and plan to continue my education sometime in 2020. I dabble a little in SQL, Python, and C, but, I would *not* call myself a "coder" just yet. 
  
### What's up with the blog?

Although nobody probably cares, this blog will be populated almost entirely by my hobbies. So, you'll most likely see a lot of posts about vintage mechanical keyboards, cars, BJJ (Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu) and ricing (desktop modifications). These few things pretty much take up all of my free time and I figured posting about them might be interesting to some. Who knows. 

### Recommended *nix resources

I figure I could plug some awesome resources for rice and keyboard modifications since that will be the majority of the content posted. Check 'em out!
